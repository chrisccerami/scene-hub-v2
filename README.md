## A Ruby on Rails app for tracking local music

The most current deployed version of the app can be found [here](https://www.scene-hub.herokuapp.com)

Scene Hub is designed as a platform for fans to connect to the musicians in their communitiy. Bands can share tour dates and locations, photos, and news with people who are looking to support local music.

#### Tour history maps

Each band's profile also features a map showing where they have toured in the past. The more a musician performs at a particular venue, the larger the map marker becomes. This can give fans an at-a-glance idea of where their favortie bands play the most often. These map markers are generated automatically based on geocoded location data from each concert's venue.

#### Email Notifications

Users can follow bands that they like, and they will be emailed whenever their favorite bands announce a new show.

#### Third Party Tools

Locations are geocoded using Geokit and Geokit-rails. The maps are generated by Mapbox. Paperclip was used along with Amazon's AWS S3 service for file uploads. Infinite scrolling was implemented using a combination of the kaminari gem and AJAX. Devise was used for user authentication. Foundation was used to aid in styling and CSS. Mailing in production is handled by the Mandrill addon for Heroku.
